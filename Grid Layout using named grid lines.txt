Grid Layout using named grid lines
[Grid Layout] Describe a grid layout using named grid lines
We can use named grid lines to describe our grid layout. Letâ€™s see how to apply this to our grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows, and how to refer to these from our grid items.


            grid-template-columns:
            [left-sidebar-start] 1fr
            [main-content-start] 2fr
            [right-sidebar-start] 1fr;



 

You can also give multi names for one line:

            grid-template-columns:
            [left-sidebar-start] 1fr
            [left-sidebar-end main-content-start] 2fr
            [main-content-end right-sidebar-start] 1fr
            [right-sidebar-end];

And we also named the last columns name as 'right-sidebar-end'.

 

Later we can control the position like this:

            grid-template-rows:
                [body-start] 6fr
                [body-end footer-start] 2fr
                [footer-end];
 

The same for the rows:

            grid-template-rows:
                [body-start] 6fr
                [body-end footer-start] 2fr
                [footer-end];
